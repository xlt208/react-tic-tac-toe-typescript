# React Tic-Tac-Toe

A personal learning project built with **React and TypeScript**.

This project is based on [the React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) and extended with additional improvements to reinforce my understanding of React fundamentals and TypeScript usage in a real project.

## Enhancements Beyond the Tutorial

In addition to completing the tutorial and its optional challenges, I made the following enhancements:

- Migrated the project from JavaScript to TypeScript and made the codebase fully TypeScript-compliant for improved type safety and maintainability.
- Parameterized the game board size to support configurable board dimensions beyond the fixed 3×3 layout.
